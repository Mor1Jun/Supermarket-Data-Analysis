Supermarket Data Analysis

This project analyzes historical sales data from a supermarket chain to guide an expansion plan. By examining factors such as product line, time of purchase, and customer demographics, we aim to provide insights into which branch should focus on for expansion.
Project Overview

The supermarket recently secured funding from a bank and is seeking to expand its operations. With limited budget and resources, the goal is to focus the expansion on one of the three branches based on data analysis.
